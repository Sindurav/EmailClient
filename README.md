# EmailClient
Simple Email Client with Angular JS
This Email Client displays list of emails from a WebAPI (https://5c5a21f9af3ff700140de477.mockapi.io/api/email) using Angular JS and Html.
This is a Single page application with List, Details and Create functionalities.
I directly fetched the details from WebAPI and haven't used any database for this application.
